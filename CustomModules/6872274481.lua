THIS SCRIPT ISN'T FOR HACKERS TO RUIN GAMES. If you don't trust it you can check it.
btw my second way to know what xylex made is his dc server. He banned me, but nvm, idc! Github website is always good :D. I always try to make scripts to detect it instead.

Detections:
AutoToxic: ‚úÖ
Fly: ‚ùå
Zephyr Speed: ‚ùå
InfiniteFly: ‚ùå 
Reach: ‚ùå 

-- Gonna make when summer holidays
